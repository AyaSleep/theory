 Is the class of languages recognized by NFAs closed under complement?
 
 The class of regular languages is closed under complementation for DFAs.
 We know that every NFA N, has an equivalent DFA, M.
 So, for every language recognized by N, the equivalent DFA, M, can recognize it too.
 Because we know that if a DFA can recognize a language it can also recognize it's complement,
 thus the class of regular languages that are recognized by NFA's is closed under complement!
